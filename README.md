# BaniDB API
Active work ongoing under the dev branch

# Vision Statement
BaniDB's vision is to create a single, universally accessible Gurbani Database for websites and applications. BaniDB is and will continue to be the most accurate and complete Gurbani database ever created.

In order to make this vision possible, members of this collaborative effort work to ensure that the platform is selfsustaining, tested, and secure. 

# Precision and Recall

BaniDB is the most preciese Gurbani database with over 38,000 corrections (and counting!). 

It is the only database in the world that is being standardized for lagamatras (spelling) and padh chhedh (word separation) versus the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee's (SGPC) published Gurbani pothis. 

Furthermore, no change to the DB is approved without at least 3 peer reviews with full citations and audit trail. This exhaustive process ensures that no individual can tamper with Gurbani.  

We have worked closely with Gursikhs and Sikh scholars around the world to build upon their previous work. These partners and collaborators include SHARE Charity UK, iGurbani, Gursevak, and others. This has allowed us to ensure we have high recall of Gurbani and Panthic sources typically sung in Kirtan or referenced in Katha.

# A Living DB

BaniDB is a collective effort up of a group of dozens of volunteers who ensure that the DB continues to grow, and is properly vetted. 

# Secure

While BaniDB is a collaborative and collective effort, it is imperative that we also ensure it is an effort that secures the sanctity of Gurbani. As a result, we have chosen to take a controlled approach in order to allow for collaboration but also ensure fidelity of Gurbani data. We welcome others to get involved, but have seen too many instances of Gurbani being misused and altered to feel comfortable making the data completely open. This approach is modeled on the approach Sikhs have traditionally taken with Gurbani.
